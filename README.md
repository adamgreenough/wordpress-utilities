# WordPress Utility Plugins
These mini one-file WordPress plugins provide a drag-and-drop install for additional basic 
functionality. Strictly no ads, no alerts and no settings pages. These plugins will not update
via the WordPress admin, but I do not anticipate many (if any) breaking changes thanks to the
simplicity and WordPress's strong commitment to backwards compatibility. You can 'Watch' this repo
to be alerted of new releases.
## Installation
1. Download the relavant `.php` file from this repo
2. Upload to your `/wp-content/plugins/` folder
3. Activate from the Plugins page in your dashboard
## Plugins List
### Disable Comments `adgr-disable-comments.php`
This mini plugin will remove the Comments menu from the admin menu, admin bar and remove comment support
on posts and pages. It will not delete existing comments.

### Disable Emoji Replacement `adgr-disable-emoji-replacement.php`
By default, WordPress will load in a custom emoji set via JavaScript and replace emojis in your 
content with images from its own for greater compatibility. These days, very few devices do not 
support emoji so you may prefer to save the download and use default OS ones instead.
