# WordPress Utility Plugins
These mini one-file WordPress plugins provide a drag-and-drop install for additional basic 
functionality. Strictly no ads, no alerts and no settings pages. These plugins will not update
via the WordPress admin, but I do not anticipate many (if any) breaking changes thanks to the
simplicity and WordPress's strong commitment to backwards compatibility. You can 'Watch' this repo
to be alerted of new releases.
## Installation
1. Download the relavant `.php` file from this repo
2. Upload to your `/wp-content/plugins/` folder
3. Activate from the Plugins page in your dashboard
## Plugins List
### Disable Comments `adgr-disable-comments.php`
This mini plugin will remove the Comments menu from the admin menu, admin bar and remove comment support
on posts and pages. It will not delete existing comments.
